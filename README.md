## How was this made?
My friend said something about saving files in his USB drive and then make a download server, i had a idea of a download site.

The name was Catload (short for Catdownload). Yeah it was pretty dumb.

Then, [Hedy](https://github.com/Hedy88) said he wanted to do something with the base HTML. So i made a repo for this.

[billygoat891](https://github.com/billygoat891) said he would help.

Then, i made 2 branches, and billy made one.

His branch is now the default one.
