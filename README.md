## DISCLAIMER - ABANDONED
This is the code of a long abandoned project, which I also worked on myself.

This repository was originally owned by [woozier](https://github.com/woozier), but he transferred it over to me some time after the project died.

The rest of this readme file was also written by him.

This project was originally hosted on woogedownload.billygoat891.tk, but billy got rid of the subdomain.

The project is now available [here](https://woogedownload.github.io)

## How was this made?
My friend said something about saving files in his USB drive and then make a download server, i had a idea of a download site.

The name was Catload (short for Catdownload). Yeah it was pretty dumb.

Then, [Hedy](https://github.com/Hedy88) said he wanted to do something with the base HTML. So i made a repo for this.

[billygoat891](https://github.com/billygoat891) said he would help.

Then, i made 2 branches, and billy made one.

His branch is now the default one.
